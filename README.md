# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (ML Project)

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.
It is a beginner-friendly classification project based on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

---

## 📌 Objective

Use passenger data (age, gender, ticket class, etc.) to build a model that can predict survival outcomes.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Train/Test Split, Accuracy Score)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is loaded from a public source:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv  
(You can also download it from [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic))

---

## 📈 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Missing Value Handling**
4. **Feature Engineering (Sex, Embarked, etc.)**
5. **Model Training (Logistic Regression)**
6. **Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)**

---

## 🎯 Model Accuracy

Logistic Regression gave an accuracy of around **75–80%** on the test data, depending on random state and split.

---

## 📁 How to Run

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Run the cells one by one
3. No need to install anything if you're using Colab

---

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Try other models like Random Forest, SVM, or XGBoost
- Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Visualize feature importance
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
